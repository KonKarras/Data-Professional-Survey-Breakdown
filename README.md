# Data-Professional-Survey-Breakdown
Recent survey conducted on 630 individuals related with the data industry, including a PowerBI dashboard, aimed for further analysis and insights.

A glimpse of the dashboard can be found in the .pdf document, although I would recommend the .pbix one for deeper and more interactive visualizations.
The original responses of each individual on each unique question can be accessed through the .xlsx document.
